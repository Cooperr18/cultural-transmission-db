Although increasing in popularity in recent years, CT has not seen extensive use in archaeological research, despite the quantitative rigor of many CT models and the ability to create testable hypotheses. Part of the reason for the slow adoption, we argue, has been the continuing focus on change in central tendency and mode in archaeology, instead of change in dispersion or variance. Yet archaeological research provides an excellent data source for exploring processes of CT. We review CT research in the anthropological sciences and outline the benefits and drawbacks of this theoretical framework for the study of material culture. We argue that CT can shed much light on our understandings of why material technology changes over time, including explanations of differential rates of change among different technologies. We further argue that transmission processes are greatly affected by the content, context, and mode of transmission and fundamentally structure variation in material culture. Including ideas from CT can provide greater context for explaining and understanding changes in the variation of artifacts over time.

L.; Feldman, Marcus W.","Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach","","978-0-691-20935-7","","","","A number of scholars have found that concepts such as mutation, selection, and random drift, which emerged from the theory of biological evolution, may also explain evolutionary phenomena in other disciplines as well. Drawing on these concepts, Professors Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman classify and systematize the various modes of transmitting ""culture"" and explore their consequences for cultural evolution. In the process, they develop a mathematical theory of the non-genetic transmission of cultural traits that provides a framework for future investigations in quantitative social and anthropological science.The authors use quantitative models that incorporate the various modes of transmission (for example, parent-child, peer-peer, and teacher-student), and evaluate data from sociology, archaeology, and epidemiology in terms of the models. They show that the various modes of transmission in conjunction with cultural and natural selection produce various rates of cultural evolution and various degrees of diversity within and between groups. The same framework can be used for explaining phenomena as apparently unrelated as linguistics, epidemics, social values and customs, and diffusion of innovations. The authors conclude that cultural transmission is an essential factor in the study of cultural change. Frontmatter -- Preface -- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -- List of Symbols -- Contents -- 1.

Whilst these models are undoubtedly valuable, this paper draws attention to persistent failings in the interpretation and application of these models by archaeologists. Despite having quite different effects, variables such as population size and population density are often used interchangeably; and whilst increasing mobility has an effect broadly equivalent to that of increasing population density, it is rarely given sufficient weight in archaeological explanations of cultural change. The analyses reported here develop a series of new simulations based on the ideal gas model, allowing for an explicit prediction of the encounter rate – the variable for which population density and mobility are proxies, and which ultimately governs the rate of cultural transmission. This model supports the predictions of earlier studies on the effects of population density and mobility, but suggests that population size will have no effect on rates of cultural transmission. These simulations are coupled with analyses that demonstrate a reciprocal correlation between population density and mobility in a large hunter-gatherer dataset. Given this correlation, it is argued that archaeological inferences about cultural transmission based on just one of these variables are unlikely to be valid. These findings are discussed in the context of previous research, and it is suggested that future studies would gain greater explanatory power by focusing explicitly on the social network structures likely to have characterised a particular archaeological population.","2016-10-01","2023-04-28 23:09:58","2023-04-28 23:28:03","2023-04-29","75-84","","","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Academic Press","","","","","Cultural transmission; Encounter rate; Hunter-gatherer; Mobility; Population density; Population size; Simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One, of course, is the methodology initiated by Darwin (1859) in the mid-nineteenth century, linked to genetics in the mid-twentieth century (e.g. Fisher 1930; Haldane 1932), and which today constitutes the foundation for the scientific understanding of the organic world and its diversity. The second explanatory system called evolution is more commonly identified as cultural evolution. Although it is frequently conceived as the application of principles of biological evolution to cultural phenomena (e.g. Yoffee 1979), even cursory examination demonstrates that it is a fundamentally different methodology (Blute 1979; Dunnell 1980). Cultural evolution, as a system of explanation, is far more ancient than biological evolution. Its rigorous expression as a “theory” is usually traced to Spencer (e.g. 1857), at about the same time as Darwin was forwarding his methodology. As was also true of biological evolution, cultural evolution fell from favor in academic circles in the early twentieth century, not to be revived until midcentury largely by the work of White (1949). White (1959b) plainly recognized that his position was at variance with evolution in the natural sciences as did many other early workers (e.g. Carneiro 1967; Sahlins and Service 1960). This revival of Spencerian evolution was initially limited to sociocultural anthropology; archaeologists found little of value in it at first (Willey 1961).","1989","2023-06-14 16:37:35","2023-06-14 16:37:47","","35-49","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1017/CBO9780511558221.003","","","","","","Lamberg-Karlovsky, C C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ninety-two, four-person chains transmitted a story containing unambiguously positive and unambiguously negative story events, along with ambiguous story events that could be interpreted positively or negatively.

Investigation of this feature in non-Western groups has found little difference cross-culturally in the frequency or manner with which individuals overimitate. However, each of the non-Western populations studied thus far has a history of close interaction with Western cultures, such that they are now far removed from life in a hunter-gatherer or other small-scale culture. To investigate overimitation in a context of limited Western cultural influences, we conducted a study with the Aka hunter-gatherers and neighboring Ngandu horticulturalists of the Congo Basin rainforest in the southern Central African Republic. Aka children, Ngandu children, and Aka adults were presented with a reward retrieval task similar to those performed in previous studies, involving a demonstrated sequence of causally relevant and irrelevant actions. Aka children were found not to overimitate as expected, instead displaying one of the lowest rates of overimitation seen under similar conditions. Aka children copied fewer irrelevant actions than Aka adults, used a lower proportion of irrelevant actions than Ngandu children and Aka adults, and had less copying fidelity than Aka adults. Measures from Ngandu children were intermediate between the two Aka groups. Of the participants that succeeded in retrieving the reward, 60% of Aka children used emulation rather than imitation, compared to 15% of Ngandu children, 11% of Aka adults, and 0% of Western children of similar age. From these results, we conclude that cross-cultural variation exists in the use of overimitation during childhood. Further study is needed under a more diverse representation of cultural and socioeconomic groups in order to investigate the cognitive underpinnings of overimitation and its possible influences on social learning and the biological and cultural evolution of our species.","2015-03-27","2023-11-29 15:00:43","2023-11-29 15:01:06","2023-11-29","e0120180","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 25816230 Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/akc47/Zotero/storage/ICZWA885/full-text.pdf","","","Culture; Adults; Animal sociality; Central African Republic; Children; Cross-cultural studies; Human learning; Toddlers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, researchers have only been able to speculate about the reasons for the apparent absence of this phenomenon in nonhumans, and it has not been possible to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying it. Here, we show that it is possible to demonstrate CCE under laboratory conditions by simulating generational succession through the repeated removal and replacement of human participants within experimental groups. We created ""microsocieties"" in which participants were instructed to complete simple tasks using everyday materials. In one of our procedures, participants were instructed to build a paper aeroplane which flew as far as possible, and in the other, they were instructed to construct a tower of spaghetti which was as tall as possible. We show that, in both cases, information accumulates within the groups such that later generations produce designs which are more successful than earlier ones. These methods offer researchers a window to understanding CCE, allowing for experimental manipulation and hypothesis testing. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching.

Accordingly, to benefit from cultural evolution’s ability to solve complex adaptive problems, learners must be credulous. However, credulity entails costs, including susceptibility to exploitation, and effort wasted due to false beliefs. One determinant of the optimal level of credulity is the ratio between the costs of two types of errors: erroneous incredulity (failing to believe information that is true) and erroneous credulity (believing information that is false). This ratio can be expected to be asymmetric when information concerns hazards, as the costs of erroneous incredulity will, on average, exceed the costs of erroneous credulity; no equivalent asymmetry characterizes information concerning benefits. Natural selection can therefore be expected to have crafted learners’ minds so as to be more credulous toward information concerning hazards. This negatively-biased credulity extends general negativity bias, the adaptive tendency for negative events to be more salient than positive events. Together, these biases constitute attractors that should shape cultural evolution via the aggregated effects of learners’ differential retention and transmission of information. In two studies in the U.S., we demonstrate the existence of negatively-biased credulity, and show that it is most pronounced in those who believe the world to be dangerous, individuals who may constitute important nodes in cultural transmission networks. We then document the predicted imbalance in cultural content using a sample of urban legends collected from the Internet and a sample of supernatural beliefs obtained from ethnographies of a representative collection of the world’s cultures, showing that beliefs about hazards predominate in both.","2014-04-15","2023-11-29 15:18:06","2023-11-29 15:18:15","2023-11-29","e95167","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 24736596 Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/akc47/Zotero/storage/TQXJMPU8/full-text.pdf","","","Culture; Anxiety; Cultural evolution; Learning; Evolutionary biology; Internet; Natural selection; Social psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This phenomenon, termed “over-imitation”, has inspired much empirical research in the past decade as well as lively theoretical debate on its cognitive underpinnings and putative role in the transmission of cultural knowledge. Here, we offer a comprehensive review of the existing literature to date, accompanied by a table including concise information on 54 published studies testing over-imitation in different species, age groups and cultures. We highlight methodological issues related to task and context that influence over-imitation rates and that should be carefully considered in study designs. We discuss the cognitive and motivational processes underlying and contributing to over-imitation, including normative action parsing, causal reasoning, motives of affiliation and social learning as well as their complex interplay. We conclude that despite the apparent irrationality of over-imitation behavior, recent studies have shown that its performance depends on the specific task, modeled actions and context variables, suggesting that over-imitation should be conceptualized as a contextually flexible and, in fact, a normally highly functional phenomenon.","2019-03-01","2023-11-29 15:20:01","2023-11-29 15:20:04","2023-11-29","90-108","","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Academic Press","","/home/akc47/Zotero/storage/X7P2J2AY/full-text.pdf","","","Imitation; Social learning; Cultural learning; Over-imitation; Social norms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models can be used as null hypotheses against which to detect non-random processes such as cultural selection or biased transmission. One proposed cultural mutation model is the accumulated copying error model, where individuals attempt to copy the size of another individual's artifact exactly but make small random errors due to physiological limits on the accuracy of their perception. Here, we first derive the model within an explicit mathematical framework, generating the predictions that multiple independently-evolving artifact chains should diverge over time such that their between-chain variance increases while the mean artifact size remains constant. We then present the first experimental test of this model in which 200 participants, split into 20 transmission chains, were asked to faithfully copy the size of the previous participant's handaxe image on an iPad. The experimental findings supported the model's prediction that between-chain variance should increase over time and did so in a manner quantitatively in line with the model. However, when the initial size of the image that the participants resized was larger than the size of the image they were copying, subjects tended to increase the size of the image, resulting in the mean size increasing rather than staying constant. This suggests that items of material culture formed by reductive vs. additive processes may mutate differently when individuals attempt to replicate faithfully the size of previously-produced artifacts. Finally, we show that a dataset of 2601 Acheulean handaxes shows less variation than predicted given our empirically measured copying error variance, suggesting that other processes counteracted the variation in handaxe size generated by perceptual cultural mutation.","2012-11-08","2023-11-29 15:23:00","2023-11-29 15:23:09","2023-11-29","e48333","","11","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 23144865 Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/akc47/Zotero/storage/BLZG8ANZ/full-text.pdf","","","Archaeology; Culture; Hominins; Paleoanthropology; Cultural evolution; Human evolution; Normal distribution; Psychophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the ?ghost display? and ?end-state? conditions, which have been used to tease apart imitative and emulative learning are evaluated. In a ghost display, the movements of an apparatus are demonstrated, often through the discrete use of fishing-line or hidden mechanisms, without a live model acting directly upon the apparatus so that the apparatus appears to be operated as if by a ?ghostly? agent. In an end-state condition, an observing individual is shown the initial state of the test apparatus, the apparatus is then manipulated out-of-sight and then represented to the individual in its final state. The aim of the ghost display condition is to determine whether individuals are able to emulate by replicating the movements of an apparatus, or perform a task, without requiring information about the bodily movements required to do so (imitation). The end-state condition is used to identify goal-emulation by assessing whether the observer can replicate the steps required to solve the task without having been shown the required body actions or task movements. The responses of individuals tested with either the ghost display and/or end-state conditions are compared to those of further individuals who have observed a full demonstration by either a human experimenter or a conspecific. The responses of a control group, to whom no information has been provided about the test apparatus or required actions, are also compared and evaluated. The efficacy of these experimental techniques employed with humans, nonhuman primates, dogs, rats and birds are discussed and evaluated. The experiments reviewed herein emphasise the need to provide ghost displays and end-state conditions in combination, along with full live demonstrations and a no-information control.

Young wild-born chimpanzees from an African sanctuary and 3- to 4-year-old children observed a human demonstrator use a tool to retrieve a reward from a puzzle-box. The demonstration involved both causally relevant and irrelevant actions, and the box was presented in each of two conditions: opaque and clear. In the opaque condition, causal information about the effect of the tool inside the box was not available, and hence it was impossible to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant parts of the demonstration. However, in the clear condition causal information was available, and subjects could potentially determine which actions were necessary. When chimpanzees were presented with the opaque box, they reproduced both the relevant and irrelevant actions, thus imitating the overall structure of the task. When the box was presented in the clear condition they instead ignored the irrelevant actions in favour of a more efficient, emulative technique. These results suggest that emulation is the favoured strategy of chimpanzees when sufficient causal information is available. However, if such information is not available, chimpanzees are prone to employ a more comprehensive copy of an observed action. In contrast to the chimpanzees, children employed imitation to solve the task in both conditions, at the expense of efficiency. We suggest that the difference in performance of chimpanzees and children may be due to a greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions, perhaps combined with a differential focus on the results, actions and goals of the demonstrator","2005","2024-04-13 15:36:08","2024-04-13 15:42:46","","164-181","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments reporting “true motor imitation” in animals do not as yet give evidence of production learning by imitation; instead, contextual imitation can explain their data, and this can be explained by a simple mechanism (response facilitation) which matches known neural findings. When imitation serves a function in social mimicry, which applies to a wide range of phenomena from neonatal imitation in humans and great apes to pair-bonding in some bird species, the fidelity of the behavioral match is crucial. Learning of novel behavior can potentially be achieved by matching the outcome of a model's action, and it is argued that vocal imitation by birds is a clear example of this method (which is sometimes called emulation). Alternatively, the behavior itself may be perceived in terms of actions that the observer can perform, and thus it may be copied. If the imitation is linear and stringlike (action level), following the surface form rather than the underlying plan, then its utility for learning new instrumental methods is limited. However, the underlying plan of hierarchically organized behavior is visible in output behavior, in subtle but detectable ways, and imitation could instead be based on this organization (program level), extracted automatically by string parsing. Currently, the most likely candidates for such capacities are all great apes. It is argued that this ability to perceive the underlying plan of action, in addition to allowing highly flexible imitation of novel instrumental methods, may have resulted in the competence to understand the intentions (theory of mind) of others.","2002","2024-04-13 15:38:24","2024-04-13 15:38:28","","77-105","","","31","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-3454(02)80006-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theories on innovation and comparative research on tool manufacturing suggest that children’s performance may depend on the task context. The current study explored whether preschool children’s poor performance in past research could be attributed to short time limits and the required manufacturing method. In four experiments, 5-year-olds needed to retrieve a toy from a tube by manufacturing a novel tool and using it successfully. The type of potentially functional materials varied among the experiments. Cumulative innovation rate was analyzed after 1 and 10 min. The 5-year-olds rarely innovated if merely “reshape” (modifying the material’s shape) was offered as a potentially successful manufacturing method even when they had up to 10 min to complete the task (21%; Experiment 1). The vast majority of 5-year-olds succeeded if multiple manufacturing strategies were functional, but only if children had up to 10 min to complete the task (93%; Experiment 2). The innovation rate remained high if “detach” (separating material from a substrate) was not available (76%; Experiment 3) and if “subtract” (removing something from a material) was the only functional manufacturing method (71%; Experiment 4). Our findings suggest that even preschool-aged children are “good innovators” if (a) they have enough time and (b) manufacturing methods other than reshape can be used to solve the problem.

We conclude that children’s difficulty is likely to be due to the ill-structured nature of tool innovation problems, in which components of a solution must be retrieved and coordinated. Older children struggled to bring to mind components of the solution but could coordinate them, whereas younger children could not coordinate components even when explicitly provided.","2014","2024-04-28 12:35:33","2024-04-28 12:35:36","","110-117","","","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social learning; Innovation; Cognitive Development; Ill-structured problems; Problem Solving; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we demonstrate how young children will continue to adopt the precise actions shown to them by an adult even if the goal of the actions is not realized during modelling. A group of 4-year-old participants were presented with a toy lying at the bottom of a Perspex tube. Despite the availability of a bottle of water, and unlike the responses of a group of adults, few children spontaneously identified the solution of pouring the water into the tube to raise the toy up the tube where it could be reached. The majority did so, however, after seeing an adult demonstrate this approach. Critically, children copied the specific method of the adult, even when this involved the unnecessary steps of pouring from the bottle into a cup before pouring from the cup into the tube.

Simple mathematical models are provided to study the joint evolution of two cultural characters, one determining the viability and the fertility of individuals, and the other determining the vertical transmission rate of the first trait. Ordinary local stability analyses indicate that intrademic processes should lead to a greater reliance on vertical cultural transmission. On the other hand, when newly arisen variants are adaptive and favored in biased cultural transmission, interdemic processes may lead to a decrease in vertical transmission. This is because biased nonvertical transmission may effectively propagate the adaptive variants, further increasing the average growth rate of the population. These results are verified under several distinct sets of assumptions. It is also inferred that the degree and intensity of transmission bias may be the important determinants of cultural processes.","1999","2024-04-29 09:43:04","2024-04-29 09:43:10","","208-225","","2","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-genetic inheritance of information across generations results from various processes that contribute to parent–offspring resemblance, a property that is called heritability.The concept of heritability has been generalized into that of inclusive heritability, which is the heredity of differences, including all forms of inheritance. It unifies genetic and non-genetic heritability into a single framework encompassing the multiple dimensions of inheritance. We briefly provide evidence for the four identified processes of non-genetic inheritance.Epigenetic changes in DNA expression result in epigenetic inheritance when they are transmitted across generations, thus contributing to the transgenerational transmission of phenotypic variation. Epigenetic changes are usually mediated by changes in environmental conditions. Examples include the inheritance of maternal behaviour in rodents or the inheritance of flower symmetry.Parental non-genetic effects can result in the inheritance of non-genetic information across generations, thus contributing to the non-genetic component of inclusive heritability. Examples include the inheritance of immunocompetence against given parasites in birds or flexible adaptation to the maternal light environment in plants.Ecological inheritance occurs when offspring inherit the habitat of their parents. This indicates that any modification of the environment that results from ancestral activity and that affects fitness will change subsequent selective pressures. Examples include the webs, nests, dams and burrows that numerous animal species create, but also the changes in atmospheric gases and soil nutrients brought about by bacteria and plant species.Culture is the part of phenotypic variance that is transmitted through social learning. Recent evidence suggests that cultural transmission is widespread among animals. Examples concern mate choice and species recognition. Cultural selection constitutes another engine of evolution when it interacts with natural selection in both animals and humans.Non-genetic inheritance can easily be confounded with genetic inheritance. It is the intricate network of genetic and non-genetic inheritance systems that produce parent–offspring resemblance, which constitutes the whole evolutionary potential of a trait quantified by inclusive heritability.We formally partition inclusive heritability and propose methods to disentangle its components in order to better integrate them into a comprehensive view of inheritance. We propose specific designs coupling field or experimental longitudinal data with animal model types of statistical tools.Such methods should help to unravel fascinating enigmas in evolution and medicine, such as major evolutionary transitions or the 'missing heritability' in the human genome.The time is ripe to broaden concepts of inheritance and heritability in order to fully grasp the richness of evolutionary processes, and we call for a multidimensional modern synthesis that would merge the current modern synthesis with an inclusive view of inheritance.","2011","2024-05-02 10:51:42","2024-05-02 10:51:48","","475-486","","7","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wider application of these insights, however, has been hampered by traditional disciplinary boundaries. To remedy this, in this volume leading researchers from theoretical biology, developmental and cognitive psychology, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, religious studies, history, and economics come together to explore the central role of cultural evolution in different aspects of human endeavor. The contributors take as their guiding principle the idea that cultural evolution can provide an important integrating function across the various disciplines of the human sciences, as organic evolution does for biology. The benefits of adopting a cultural evolutionary perspective are demonstrated by contributions on social systems, technology, language, and religion. Topics covered include enforcement of norms in human groups, the neuroscience of technology, language diversity, and prosociality and religion. The contributors evaluate current research on cultural evolution and consider its broader theoretical and practical implications, synthesizing past and ongoing work and sketching a roadmap for future cross-disciplinary efforts.","2013","2024-05-06 18:44:04","2024-05-06 18:44:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","MIT Press","Cambridge, MA","","","","","","","","Series Title: Strungmann forum reports","","","","","BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES/Evolution; COGNITIVE SCIENCES/General; Human evolution -- Religious aspects; Social evolution; Technological innovations -- Social aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, by endorsing a single expanded unit of inheritance and leaving the classical molecular notion of gene intact, DST achieves only a nominal reunification of heredity and development. I argue that an alternative conceptualization of inheritance denies the classical opposition of genetics and development while avoiding the singularity inherent in the replicator concept. It also yields a new unit--the reproducer--which genuinely integrates genetic and developmental perspectives.

Cultural traits can be passed vertically (from parents to offspring), obliquely (from the previous generation via a nonparent model to younger individuals), or horizontally (between unrelated individuals from similar age classes or within generations) [4]. Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have a highly stereotyped, repetitive, and progressively evolving vocal sexual display or “song” [14, 15, 16, 17] that functions in sexual selection (through mate attraction and/or male social sorting) [18, 19, 20]. All males within a population conform to the current version of the display (song type), and similarities may exist among the songs of populations within an ocean basin [16, 17, 21]. Here we present a striking pattern of horizontal transmission: multiple song types spread rapidly and repeatedly in a unidirectional manner, like cultural ripples, eastward through the populations in the western and central South Pacific over an 11-year period.

Results from multimodel inference reveal that prestige is a significant factor in determining the salience and recall of information, but that several content biases, specifically social, survival, negative emotional, and biological counterintuitive information, are significantly more influential. Further, we find evidence that reliance on prestige cues may serve as a conditional learning strategy when no content cues are available. Our results demonstrate that content biases serve a vital and underappreciated role in cultural transmission and cultural evolution.

This paper explores one source of variation, copying errors, and systematically examines how cultural transmission processes act to amplify, reduce, or maintain such variation. Using simple models, we generate expected distributions for the amount of variation that occurs through time under varying circumstances. This variation is caused by small errors that are transmitted from one person to another in the propagation and replication of cultural traits.

Here I present two fully preregistered online experiments that explicitly investigated the differences between these two modalities of transmission. The first experiment (N = 1,080 participants) examined whether negative content, information eliciting disgust, and threat-related information were better transmitted than their neutral counterpart in a traditional transmission chain setup. The second experiment (N = 1,200 participants) used the same material, but participants were asked whether or not they would share the content in two conditions: in a large anonymous social network or with their friends, in their favorite social network. Negative content was both better transmitted in transmission chain experiments and shared more than its neutral counterpart. Threat-related information was successful in transmission chain experiments but not when sharing, and finally, information eliciting disgust was not advantaged in either. Overall, the results present a composite picture, suggesting that the interactions between the specific content and the medium of transmission are important and, possibly, that content biases are stronger when memorization and reproduction are involved in the transmission—as in oral transmission—than when they are not—as in online sharing.

Yet how far the analogy between cultural and genetic evolution should be pushed is open to debate. Here, we examine a recent disagreement that concerns the extent to which cultural transmission should be considered a preservative mechanism allowing selection among different variants, or a transformative process in which individuals recreate variants each time they are transmitted. The latter is associated with the notion of “cultural attraction”. This issue has generated much misunderstanding and confusion. We first clarify the respective positions, noting that there is in fact no substantive incompatibility between cultural attraction and standard cultural evolution approaches, beyond a difference in focus. Whether cultural transmission should be considered a preservative or reconstructive process is ultimately an empirical question, and we examine how both preservative and reconstructive cultural transmission has been studied in recent experimental research in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss how the relative importance of preservative and reconstructive processes may depend on the granularity of analysis and the domain being studied.","2015","2024-06-24 21:54:19","2024-06-27 22:01:11","","481-503","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also has the potential to tell us when and how human social learning becomes cultural learning; i.e. mediated by psychological mechanisms that are specialized, genetically or culturally, to promote cultural inheritance. However, this review article argues that, to realize its potential, research on the development of selective social learning needs more clearly to distinguish functional from mechanistic explanation; to achieve integration with research on attention and learning in adult humans and ?dumb? animals; and to recognize that psychological mechanisms can be specialized, not only by genetic evolution, but also by associative learning and cultural evolution.","2015-03-01","2024-06-26 17:19:31","2024-06-27 22:01:07","","1-14","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultural learning is identified with those instances of social learning in which intersubjectivity or perspective-taking plays a vital role, both in the original learning process and in the resulting cognitive product. Cultural learning manifests itself in three forms during human ontogeny: imitative learning, instructed learning, and collaborative learning – in that order. Evidence is provided that this progression arises from the developmental ordering of the underlying social-cognitive concepts and processes involved. Imitative learning relies on a concept of intentional agent and involves simple perspective-taking. Instructed learning relies on a concept of mental agent and involves alternating/coordinated perspective-taking (intersubjectivity). Collaborative learning relies on a concept of reflective agent and involves integrated perspective-taking (reflective intersubjectivity). A comparison of normal children, autistic children and wild and enculturated chimpanzees provides further evidence for these correlations between social cognition and cultural learning. Cultural learning is a uniquely human form of social learning that allows for a fidelity of transmission of behaviors and information among conspecifics not possible in other forms of social learning, thereby providing the psychological basis for cultural evolution.","1993","2024-06-26 17:42:32","2024-06-27 22:00:58","","495-511","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","theory of mind; social learning; cultural learning; imitation; culture; animal cognition; attention; cognitive development; collaboration; instruction; intentionality; intersubjectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially the case with identifying different kinds of social learning reflected in the record. Here we present a computational approach to social learning using a new model that compares frequencies of stylistic traits through time to an evolutionary model of social learning. Two dimensions of cultural evolution—popularity bias and information transparency—help unify a range of hitherto competing models of social learning. This model has never successfully been calibrated to real-world data, with the sparseness of archaeological data presenting an even further challenge. By calibrating the model to archaeological data, we confirm that it can be used successfully to characterize cultural transmission in the past. Our case study consists of decorative motifs on pottery from Early Neolithic Europe, ca. 5400–5000 BCE. The comparison of data to model is highly computational, involving seven different metrics and hundreds of simulations and re-samplings. Inferences are made using approximate Bayesian computation and a random-forest algorithm to estimate the best solution using a combination of all metrics. The computational modeling confirms that cultural transmission of the Neolithic pottery motifs was a process of unbiased social learning and opens the way for the exploration of a wide range of frequency data.","2023","2024-06-27 21:55:53","2024-12-01 23:03:16","","101545","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural transmission; Social learning; LBK; Bayesian estimation; Information transparency; Neutral model; Popularity bias; Utility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis shows three things: (1) that environmental learning alone never produces the 5-shaped adoption dynamics typically observed in the spread of novel practices, ideas, and technologies; (2) that biased cultural transmission always produces the S-shaped temporal dynamics; and (3) that a combination of environmental learning and biased cultural transmission can generate 5-dynamics but only when biased cultural transmission is the predominate force in the spread of new behaviors.

We suggest that practical, social, and adaptive mechanisms were in force in certain areas of human behaviour and led to enhanced innovation, while conservatism was preferred in handaxe technology and use. In this study we emphasise the dependency of Acheulean groups on calories obtained from large mammals, and especially megafauna, as well as the central role of handaxes in processing large carcasses. It is our contention that the handaxe’s role in Acheulean adaptation was pivotal and it thus became fixed in human society, probably through the psychological bias towards majority imitation, which subsequently became a social norm or tradition. In brief, we suggest that the technological persistence of the Acheulean handaxe played an adaptive role that was based on a preferred cultural conservatism and led to the successful survival of Lower Palaeolithic populations over hundreds of thousands of years in the Old World.","2018","2024-07-02 21:44:38","2024-07-02 21:55:36","","1-19","","","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","innovation; Acheulean; conservatism; handaxe; learning; Palaeolithic; stagnation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we set up a classic transmission chain experiment, which involves making clay anthropomorphic figurines, to explore the nature of the copying error related to the production of 3D objects. The experiment consists of four independent transmission chains, each with 10 participants. Three chains are non-expert chains, as they consist of students of archaeology and psychology with no formal training in arts. The fourth is an expert chain consisting of art students. Our results show that the copying error predictably differs between the experts and the non-experts – it is lower in the expert chain. However, in both groups, the error is higher than predicted by the models that assume that the copying error is only due to imperfections in the perception of linear dimensions. Taken together, these two results suggest that, in addition to the error in perception, the error in the execution contributes significantly to the overall error, as predicted by the recently formulated object-mediated transmission model (Crema et al., 2023). The results of our experiment also show that the errors are often biased rather than random, suggesting that the transmission process involves the transformations anticipated by the cultural attraction theory.","2024","2024-07-03 15:45:00","2024-07-03 15:45:00","","105914","","","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copying error; Cultural attraction; Cultural transmission; Experiment; Figurine; Transmission chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additional reports of chimpanzee culture have since accumulated, which involve an increasing amount of behavioral variation that has no obvious ecological or genetic explanation. To date, close to 50 cultural variants have been reported, including subsistence behavior, tool-use, communication signals, and grooming patterns. Nevertheless, field studies lack the experimental controls and manipulations necessary to conclusively demonstrate that the observed variation results from differential invention and social transmission of behavior. This would require that behavioral variants have been learned from others, a question best addressed in a controlled experimental setting. The following chapter details a series of experimental studies at Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University. In each case, the behavior of two captive groups (each N=12 individuals) was compared before and after the introduction of a novel foraging behavior by a trained conspecific “inventor.” The studies were designed to investigate (i) the conditions under which chimpanzees learn from one another, (ii) how behaviors are transmitted, (iii) how cultures are maintained over generations. The results emphasize the importance of integrating both fieldwork and experimental approaches. Previous studies have reported deficits in chimpanzees' cultural capacities, but did so after testing them with human models, which are largely irrelevant to the problem at hand. A representative understanding of culture can only be gained when efforts are made to create a naturalistic learning environment in which chimpanzees have opportunities to learn spontaneously from conspecifics in a familiar social setting.","2009","2024-10-20 17:57:54","2024-11-11 07:12:52","","3-15","","","178","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17801-9","","","","","culture; learning; chimpanzee; evolution; human","Chiao, Joan Y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, starting with identification in a few species, evidence that animals can learn and transmit behaviors has accumulated at an ever-increasing pace. Today, there is no doubt that culture is widespread among animal species, both vertebrates and invertebrates, marine and terrestrial. Whiten reviews evidence for animal culture and elaborates on the wide array of forms that such culture takes. Recognizing that other species have complex and varied culture has implications for conservation and welfare and for understanding the evolution of this essential component of animal societies, including our own. Science, this issue p. eabe6514 Culture can be defined as all that is learned from others and is repeatedly transmitted in this way, forming traditions that may be inherited by successive generations. This cultural form of inheritance was once thought specific to humans, but research over the past 70 years has instead revealed it to be widespread in nature, permeating the lives of a diversity of animals, including all major classes of vertebrates. Recent studies suggest that culture?s reach may extend also to invertebrates?notably, insects. In the present century, the reach of animal culture has been found to extend across many different behavioral domains and to rest on a suite of social learning processes facilitated by a variety of selective biases that enhance the efficiency and adaptiveness of learning. Far-reaching implications, for disciplines from evolutionary biology to anthropology and conservation policies, are increasingly being explored.","2021-04-02","2024-10-20 17:58:56","2024-11-11 07:13:32","","eabe6514","","6537","372","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this wide range of applications provides an opportunity for the development of generalisable analytical workflows, archaeological data present new questions and challenges that require further methodological and theoretical discussion. Here we examine the decorative motifs of Neolithic pottery from an archaeological assemblage in Western Germany, and argue that the widely used (and relatively undiscussed) assumption that observed frequencies are the result of a system in equilibrium conditions is unwarranted, and can lead to incorrect conclusions. We analyse our data with a simulation-based inferential framework that can overcome some of the intrinsic limitations in archaeological data, as well as handle both equilibrium conditions and instances where the mode of cultural transmission is time-variant. Results suggest that none of the models examined can produce the observed pattern under equilibrium conditions, and suggest. instead temporal shifts in the patterns of cultural transmission.","2016","2024-11-14 18:39:39","2024-11-14 19:07:49","","39122","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evolutionary approaches to this problem typically cast the causes of culture change as being either stochastic in origin, or arising from selection. Stochastic sources of change include random innovations, copying errors, drift and founder effects among dispersing groups. Selection is driven by differences in payoffs between cultural variants. Most efforts to identify these evolutionary forces in the archaeological record have relied on assessing how well the predictions from a neutral-stochastic model of cultural transmission fit a data set. Selection is inferred when the neutral-stochastic model fits poorly. A problem with this approach is that it does not test directly for the presence selection. Moreover, it does not account for the fact that both neutral-stochastic and selective forces can act at the same time on the same cultural variants. A different approach based on the Price Equation allows for the simultaneous measurement of selective and stochastic forces. This paper extends use of the Price Equation to the analysis of selective and stochastic forces operating on multiple artifact types within an assemblage. Ceramic data presented by Steele et al. (2010, Vol. 37(6): 1348–1358) from the Late Bronze Age Hittite site of Boğazköy-Hattusa, Turkey, provide an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of this model. The results suggest that selection is a dominant process driving the frequency evolution of different bowl rim types within the assemblage and that stochastic forces played little or no role. It is also clear, however, that we should be attentive to combinations of direct and indirect selective effects within assemblages consisting of multiple artifact types.","2010","2024-11-28 17:43:03","2024-12-05 19:48:17","","3211-3225","","12","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural transmission; Cultural evolution; Evolutionary archaeology; Ceramic technology; Indirect selection; Mutation–drift equilibrium; Neutral evolution; Price Equation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How can we tell if a variant has been preferentially selected or discriminated against, and become more or less frequent than would be expected under pure drift (i.e. random copying, with the compounding over time of proportionate sampling error)? We examined a database of Hittite ceramic bowl types from two successive Phases of occupation of the Upper City of Boğazköy–Hattusa, capital of the Hittite empire and the largest Bronze Age settlement in Turkey. We applied two tests used in genetics to assess departures from neutrality, to assess selectivity in rates of reproduction of ceramic bowl types (the Ewens-Watterson and Slatkin's Exact tests). We also examined the effects of ceramic fabric and vessel dimensions on changes in vessel abundance between the two Phases, using regression analysis. We found that while the frequency distribution of rim sherds did not in itself enable us to reject the null hypothesis of random copying, closer examination of the characteristics of these types enabled us to recognize latent dimensions of functional variability (including ware type and bowl diameter) that had demonstrably been the subject of selective decision-making by the potters. The present case study suggests that we should be wary of applying the neutral model from genetics uncritically in archaeology, because it is much harder to prove that the cultural traits whose frequencies are being modelled are genuinely functionally equivalent (as that model requires).","2010","2024-11-28 17:43:03","2024-12-05 19:48:17","","1348-1358","","6","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural transmission; Selection; Neutral model; Archaeological ceramics; Drift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variation is defined as functional if it is affected by selection processes and as stylistic if it is a result of processes of random drift. The argument has been further developed by Neiman (1995), who showed by simulation that processes of cultural mutation and drift could produce the kinds of ""battleship curves"" that generally characterize artifact-style frequency distributions through time, and also demonstrated that they could account for patterns of stylistic variation through time in Woodland-period ceramic assemblages from Illinois. In this paper we present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery from early Neolithic Central Europe. We show that the actual diachronic frequency distributions and those expected under the neutral model do not coincide and conclude that in this case the neutral model does not provide an adequate description of change in ceramic decoration. A model involving selection, in the form of a bias in favor of novelty in the later phases of the period studied, seems likely to be more appropriate, and we note the social interpretation of the original investigator of the data. In conclusion, it is suggested that neutral models provide an important heuristic tool but that there is not a radical break between functional and stylistic variation.","2001","2024-12-01 23:02:18","2024-12-05 19:48:17","","577-593","","4","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we focus on commonly used neutrality tests and discuss the interpretation of their results. We argue that one needs to be careful with interpreting the consistency (or inconsistency) of archaeological data with theoretical neutral expectations as evidence for the absence (or presence) of selective force in the population. While neutral theory does very well in replicating various population-level frequency patterns, many alternative processes of cultural transmission may do so, too, making the pattern-matching approach a fairly weak approach for inferring underlying transmission processes. We advocate the use of generative inference frameworks as one possibility to go beyond the hypothesis testing approach. These frameworks do not only allow for the identification of the most likely underlying learning process given the empirical data but for a description of the breadth of processes that could have produced these data equally well. This brings us a step closer to understanding the limits to inferring underlying transmission processes from population-level frequency data and therefore the kinds of questions can be answered with which kinds of data.","2019","2024-12-01 23:03:00","2024-12-05 19:48:17","","83-108","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-11117-5_5","","","","","","Prentiss, Anna Marie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present a non-equilibrium neutral model which accounts for temporally varying population sizes and mutation rates and makes it possible to analyse the cultural system under consideration at any point in time. This framework gives an indication whether observed changes in the frequency distributions of a set of cultural variants between two time points are consistent with the random copying hypothesis. We find that the likelihood of the existence of the observed assemblage at the end of the considered time period (expressed by the probability of the observed number of cultural variants present in the population during the whole period under neutral evolution) is a powerful indicator of departures from neutrality. Further, we study the effects of frequency-dependent selection on the evolutionary trajectories and present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery in early Neolithic Central Europe. Based on the framework developed we show that neutral evolution is not an adequate description of the observed changes in frequency.","2013","2024-12-01 23:04:09","2024-12-05 19:48:17","","18-25","","","330","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Neutral model; Conformity; Linear pottery culture; Markov chains; Wright–Fisher model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Archaeologists have been among the front-runners of those engaging with this endeavour, and the last 2 decades have seen a number of case studies where modes of social learning were inferred from the changing frequencies of artefacts. Here, we employ a simulation model to review and examine under-discussed assumptions shared by many of these applications on the nature of what constitutes the ‘population’ under study. We specifically ask (1) whether cultural transmission via ‘objects’ (i.e. public manifestations of cultural traits) generates distinct patterns from those expected from direct transmission between individuals and (2) whether basing inference on the frequency of objects rather than on the frequency of mental representations underlying the production of those objects may lead to biased interpretations. Our results show that the rate at which ideational cultural traits are embedded in objects, and shared as such, has a measurable impact on how we infer cultural transmission processes when analysing frequency-based archaeological data. At the same time, when cultural transmission is entirely mediated by the material representation of ideas, we argue that copying error should be interpreted as a two-step process which may occur in either one or both of embedding information in objects and retrieving it from them.","2024","2024-12-05 06:01:18","2024-12-05 19:48:17","","202-226","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a crucial challenge persists: closing the gap between theoretical models and real-world data. We propose a computational workflow that starts with theoretical models and directly guides data analysis, focusing on logically and transparently connecting theoretical implications with statistical procedures. Importantly, we also show how to step back from the basic outputs of data analysis to implications for both the studied population and theoretical model, highlighting avenues for the use of both ethnographic and experimental information. We argue these steps are not only necessary for principled research but contribute key insights to recent debates on scientific reform. Cultural evolution applies evolutionary concepts and tools to explain the change of culture over time. Despite advances in both theoretical and empirical methods, the connections between cultural evolutionary theory and evidence are often vague, limiting progress. Theoretical models influence empirical research but rarely guide data collection and analysis in logical and transparent ways. Theoretical models themselves are often too abstract to apply to specific empirical contexts and guide statistical inference. To help bridge this gap, we outline a quality-assurance computational workflow that starts from generative models of empirical phenomena and logically connects statistical estimates to both theory and real-world explanatory goals. We emphasize and demonstrate validation of the workflow using synthetic data. Using the interplay between conformity, migration, and cultural diversity as a case study, we present coded and repeatable examples of directed acyclic graphs, tailored agent-based simulations, a probabilistic transmission model for longitudinal data, and an approximate Bayesian computation model for cross-sectional data. We discuss the assumptions, opportunities, and pitfalls of different approaches to generative modeling and show how each can be used to improve data analysis depending on the structure of available data and the depth of theoretical understanding. Throughout, we highlight the significance of ethnography and of collecting basic cultural and demographic information about study populations and call for more emphasis on logical and theory-driven workflows as part of science reform.","2024-11-26","2025-03-02 13:36:26","2025-03-02 13:36:32","","e2322887121","","48","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conformity is more than just a tendency to follow the majority; it involves an exaggerated tendency to follow the majority. The “exaggerated” part of this definition ensures that conformists do not show just any bias toward the majority, but a bias sufficiently strong to increase the size of the majority through time. This definition of conformity is compelling because it is the only form of frequency-dependent social influence that produces behaviorally homogeneous social groups. We conducted an experiment to see if players were conformists by separating individual and social learners. Players chose between two technologies repeatedly. Payoffs were random, but one technology had a higher expected payoff. Individual learners knew their realized payoffs after each choice, while social learners only knew the distribution of choices among individual learners. A subset of social learners behaved according to a classic model of conformity. The remaining social learners did not respond to frequency information.

We find that when traits are actively selected on the basis of their frequency, then the power-law distribution is severely disrupted. Conformity generates a “winner-takes-all” distribution in which popular traits dominate, while anti-conformity generates a “humped” distribution in which traits of intermediate frequency are favoured. However, a more passive frequency-dependent “trimming”, in which traits are selectively ignored on the basis of their frequency, generates reasonable approximations to the power-law distribution.

Such cultural transmission is based on complex, derived psychological mechanisms that are likely to have been shaped by natural selection. It is important to understand the nature of these evolved psychological mechanisms because they determine which beliefs and values spread and persist in human groups. Boyd and Richerson showed that a tendency to acquire the most common behavior exhibited in a society was adaptive in a simple model of evolution in a spatially varying environment, because such a tendency increases the probability of acquiring adaptive beliefs and values. Here, we study the evolution of such “conformist transmission” in a more general model in which environments vary in both time and space. The analysis of this model indicates that conformist transmission is favored under a very broad range of conditions, broader in fact than the range of conditions that favor a substantial reliance on social learning. The analysis also suggests that there is a synergistic relationship between the evolution of imitation and the evolution of conformism. We conclude by examining the role of conformism in explaining the maintenance of cultural differences among groups.","1998","2025-06-15 14:36:14","2025-06-15 14:36:25","","215-241","","4","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Culture; Evolution; Conformism; Conformist transmission; Cultural boundaries; Dual inheritance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we employ a long-term and regional framework to analyse the transmission of languages and craft traditions amongst Californian Indian groups. Initial results suggest that basketry assemblages exhibit a significant ethnogenetic signal, arising from the horizontal transmission of cultural attributes across sharply defined linguistic boundaries. These findings converge with those from other regions, where geographic propinquity rather than linguistic affinity has been shown to have a slightly greater—but not exclusive—influence on the composition of material culture assemblages. However, the results presented here also indicate that despite these broader similarities local basketry traditions remain relatively distinct, and therefore cannot be explained through ethnogenesis alone.

Potential for equifinality exists in all empirical studies of cultural transmission including controlled experiments, observational field research, and computational simulations. Acknowledging and anticipating the existence of equifinality is important in empirical studies of social learning and cultural evolution; it helps us understand the limitations of analytical approaches and can improve our ability to predict the dynamics of cultural transmission. Here, I illustrate and discuss examples of equifinality in studies of social learning, and how certain experimental designs might be prone to it. I then review examples of equifinality discussed in the social learning literature, namely the use of s-shaped diffusion curves to discern individual from social learning and operational definitions and analytical approaches used in studies of conformist transmission. While equifinality exists to some extent in all studies of social learning, I make suggestions for how to address instances of it, with an emphasis on using data simulation and methodological verification alongside modern statistical approaches that emphasize prediction and model comparison. In cases where evaluated learning mechanisms are equifinal due to non-methodological factors, I suggest that this is not always a problem if it helps us predict cultural change. In some cases, equifinal learning mechanisms might offer insight into how both individual learning, social learning strategies and other endogenous social factors might by important in structuring cultural dynamics and within- and between-group heterogeneity.","2019","2025-06-15 16:49:13","2025-06-15 16:49:19","","129-138","","","161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural evolution; Social learning; Equifinality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural selection favored social learners who could evaluate potential models and copy the most successful among them. In order to improve the fidelity and comprehensiveness of such ranked-biased copying, social learners further evolved dispositions to sycophantically ingratiate themselves with their chosen models, so as to gain close proximity to, and prolonged interaction with, these models. Once common, these dispositions created, at the group level, distributions of deference that new entrants may adaptively exploit to decide who to begin copying. This generated a preference for models who seem generally “popular.” Building on social exchange theories, we argue that a wider range of phenomena associated with prestige processes can more plausibly be explained by this simple theory than by others, and we test its predictions with data from throughout the social sciences. In addition, we distinguish carefully between dominance (force or force threat) and prestige (freely conferred deference).","2001","2025-06-28 19:50:50","2025-06-28 19:51:05","","165-196","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural transmission; Social learning; Dual inheritance theory; Prestige; Prestige-biased transmission; Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neutral model of evolution, first developed by Kimura in the 1960s, has become the standard against which selection is detected. While the balance between these two important forces – drift and selection – has been well established in biology there are other domains where the contribution of these processes is still coming together. Although the idea of natural selection has been applied to the cultural domain since the time of Darwin, it has proven more challenging to positively identify cultural traits under selection both because of a lack of established tests for selection and a lack of large cultural data sets. However, in recent years with the accumulation of large cultural data sets many cultural features from pre-history pottery to modern baby names have been shown to evolve according to the neutral theory. But there is accumulating empirical evidence from cultural processes suggesting that the neutral theory alone cannot account for all features of the data. As such, there has been a renewed interest in determining whether there is selection amidst drift. Here we analyze a subset English word frequencies, and determine whether frequency change reveals processes of selection. Inspired by the Moran and Wright–Fisher models in population genetics, we developed a neutral model of word frequency variation to assess when linguistic data appears to depart from neutral evolution. As such, our model represents a possible “test for selection” in the linguistic domain. We explore how the distribution of word use has changed for sets of words in English for more than 100 years (1901–2008) as expressed in vocabulary usage in published books, made available by Google Ngram. When comparing empirical word frequency changes to our neutral model we find pervasive and systematic departures from neutrality.","2016","2025-07-05 10:59:23","2025-07-05 10:59:35","","140-149","","","405","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Evolution; Selection; Drift; Causal state; Language; Word frequencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also is the source of much disagreement about how we should conceive of the processes of culture change. Evolutionary archaeologists tend to view archaeological attributes as either functional, if they respond to selection, or stylistic, if they do not. Others tend to see style and function as operating simultaneously. A resolution to this problem is proposed through development of a formal mathematical model of style- and function-based evolution using a hypothetical example of temporal patterns of ceramic decoration within a community of household-based potters. Simple replicator equations are proposed to describe the household-scale dynamics of change in the relative frequency of ceramic decoration. These low-level dynamics can be distinguished on the basis of whether or not change is correlated with some measure of performance, utility, or payoff. The replicator equations are then used to derive several versions of the Price Equation (Price 1970), a very general and powerful statement about total evolutionary change in any system. At this scale of analysis, total change is similarly partitioned into payoff-correlated (functional) and payoff-independent (stylistic) contributions and it is shown that these processes are likely to operate simultaneously. Tests of the model against simulated data show that it is possible to estimate with considerable accuracy the strength of functional and stylistic contributions to culture change under ideal conditions of site preservation. Further theoretical work is needed, however, to understand how diverse site formation and disturbance processes might impact application of the model in real archaeological settings.","2007","2025-07-05 11:36:12","2025-07-05 11:36:21","","395-416","","3","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, the underlying mechanisms of agricultural expansion have been a topic of debate, centered around two primary models: cultural diffusion, involving the transfer of knowledge and practices, and demic diffusion, characterized by the migration and replacement of populations. More recently, ancient DNA analyses have revealed significant ancestry changes during Europe’s Neolithic transition, suggesting a primarily demic expansion. Nonetheless, the presence of 10-15% hunter-gatherer ancestry in modern Europeans indicates cultural transmission and between-group mating were additional contributing factors. Here, we integrate mathematical models, agent-based simulations, and ancient DNA analysis to dissect and quantify the roles of cultural diffusion and between-group mating in farming’s expansion. Our findings indicate limited cultural transmission and predominantly within-group mating. Additionally, we challenge the assumption that demic expansion always leads to ancestry turnover.

Previous models of such incorporation deal only with vertical cultural transmission (interbreeding) and horizontal cultural transmission (acculturation of individuals of the second population by members of the first one and of similar age). Here we present the first model of oblique transmission (acculturation by individuals of an older generation), which is more complicated because a model with age structure is necessary. We compare the new, age-structured model for oblique, horizontal and vertical transmission. The most powerful mechanism (fastest fronts) is oblique transmission. Two illustrative applications of Neolithic front propagation are presented. In one of them, the front was so fast that neither horizontal nor vertical transmission can explain it (but oblique transmission can). In the cases for which cultural transmission is a viable explanation, the observed front speed yields bounds on the intensity of cultural transmission. Our models are also of interest in many other Neolithic and non-Neolithic human range expansions, including major human migrations. Additionally, in future work the new age-structured models reported in this paper could be applied to model genetic gradients and, possibly, to similar phenomena in other species in which cultural transmission is well-known to occur.","2021-07-01","2025-08-26 15:15:30","2025-08-26 15:15:30","2025-08-26 15:15:30","111060","","","148","","Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Age-structured models; Cultural diffusion; Front propagation; Neolithic; Nonlinear population dynamics; Reaction-diffusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
